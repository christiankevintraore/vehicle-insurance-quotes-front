# vehicle-insurance-quotes-front

This application was created as part of the [Connex Telecommunica.ons Angular / Java Project](TakeHome_Assignment_FullStack.pdf) demo.

It was bootstrapped using the [ngx-rocket starter kit](https://github.com/ngx-rocket/starter-kit), which supports both French and English.

The purpose of this application is to be built and served as a static resource in a Spring Boot application.

There are three views:

1. The home page: designed for form editing.
2. The quote view: displays quote data in different colors based on the success or failure status.
3. A refresh page: useful when the app is served by a serverless function that can stop running based on configuration.


# Getting started

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```
 
2. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:
 ```bash
 npm start
 ```

# Build

1. To avoid CORS policy validation issues, configure your server host in the [environment.prod.ts](src/environments/environment.prod.ts) file.

2. Build the project:
 ```bash
 ng build
 ```

3. Copy all generated files from the [dist](dist) directory into the static folder of your Spring Boot Application.
